# Open Source Marketplace
This may surprizes you but VS-Code and it's marketplace aren't really open source, is licensed under a not-FLOSS license and contains telemetry/tracking, [read more...](https://vscodium.com/)

This extension is built for [open-vsx](https://open-vsx.org/) and published on the ONLY [open source registry](https://open-vsx.org/about) for VS Code extensions.

<!-- 
If you are reading this, it's because I opened sourced it. Hopefully you love open source as much as me...

Don't share this code comment with anyone. It'll be our little inside joke.

Wanna conduct an expirment together?
1. Give this extension 5 stars. Write an awesome review.
2. Share it and promote it on social media, twitter, facebook, linkedin, etc... 
3. Lets see if we can get ~20-100k downloads.
4. Just as people are getting hooked, I'll uncomment the text below. 
    Then remove the extension from the stor at a random time to raise awareness about open source.
    If you are a publisher of an extension, or snippet, you do the same thing.

<!-- 
## Installing
The simplest way is to install command line.
`code --install-extension myextension.vsix` -->

## Notes
Bootstrap 5 is currently in alpha and this extension should be considered in the same status.
Unlike a lot of other snippets, this extension aims to balence user simplicity, with power and flexibility by keeping the **total number of snippets to a minimum**. 

In terms of **user simplicity**, other Bootstrap 4 snippets have 5 different snippets for the grid, whereas this will have 3, but each is more powerful.

## Roadmap
* v1.2.5 - Introduces Flex utilities, media-query and awesome awesome 4.7.0.
* v1.6-8 - Each snippet with eventually have a gif demo (SOON).
* v2 - All base [templates](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) and several others will be one tab away, so consider  [sponsoring this](https://github.com/sponsors/HansUXdev/) or giving it a star.

## Powerful Utility Classes
There are two way to use utilities.
1. **Class utilities**, which use `!` as a prefix. For example, if you want to add a utility class to an existing HTML element, inside of `class=" "` you would add `class="!spacing"` then hit tab and fill out the options, the default will be `class="mx-auto"` which sets margin to auto on left and right (x).
2. **Wrapper elements**, ex: `b5-{txt,color,shadow,boder,spacing}` which will create a div, p, h2 then allow you to tab through the options. 

Trigger | Description
--- | ---
`!spacing` or `b5-spacing` | A single, powerful utility snippet. The default is `mx-auto` which adds margins on right and left. The options allow you to switch between (m)argin and (p)adding, x,y,(t)op,(r)ight, (b)ottom, (l)eft, etc. Read about the classes on the [official bootstrap documentation](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/).
`!shadow` or `b5-shadow` | Useful whenever you want to make things look like paper or material design. Read about the classes on the [official bootstrap documentation](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/). https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/shadows/
`!font` or `b5-text` | This intentionally uses two different names to differentiate between the class utility and the wrapper element. The options are responsive positions `{|sm,md,lg,xl|}-${|left,center,right|}`, line-height `base,1,sm,lg}`, font-weight `normal,italic,weight-normal,weight-bold,weight-bolder,weight-light,weight-lighter` ,and `text-${6|none,lowercase,uppercase,capitalize|}`, decoration and `reset,break,monospace` !
`b5-border` | change border attributes all border attributes. Read about the classes on the [official bootstrap documentation](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/borders/).

### Educational Repos
The author does **a lot more** than just publishing a json file for snippets.

Here are just a few things he's working on, while taking care of his 👶 as a full-time single father, job hunting & competing in hackathons...

Trigger | Description & Info
--- | ---
[JavaScript-First](https://github.com/HansUXdev/JavaScript-First) | An Open Source Book that teaches anyone how to code with JavaScript using the node.js runtime environment rather than a browser and by the end, you will build a server and a website using JavaScript..
[Learn Mongo GitPod](https://github.com/HansUXdev/LearnMongoGitPod)| A repo designed to teach mongoDB to people with zero experiance and zero config, meaning you can learn on virtually any device that has a browser that GitPod can run on! This 🤞may🤞 become part of Free Code Camp [[1](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-is-new-content-created-at-fcc/416191/3)], [[2](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/103)].


### Future Snippets & Extensions
Name | Description
--- | ---
[JavaScript-First](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HansUXdev.javascript-first-snippets)  | JavaScript First is a huge collection of snippets built to establish better code habits for working with JS-based servers, browser methods, react, mongo databases and more. It is also meant to be paired with the book, [JavaScript-First](https://github.com/HansUXdev/JavaScript-First).
Foundation 6 Snippets| This will start as a snippets for [sites](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and then be updated for.
Code Slides | A snippet extension for creating educational slides with [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) and a custom theme. (not public yet)
Foundation 6 Snippets| This will start as a snippets for [sites](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) and then be updated for.[email](https://get.foundation/emails). If sponsored, I will extend this to eventually replace the [CLI](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-cli) and [building blocks](https://get.foundation/building-blocks/) by implementing a custom feature that writes install kits in a similar way the [web boilerplate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesqquick.web-boilerplate) writes an html, css, and js file.  (not started yet)

### Social Entrepreneurship: Open Source Non-Profit
I'm in the process of founding a non-profit dedicated to promoting open source by doing the following and can only commit to the first two without proper sponsorship:
Name | Description
--- | ---
Creating open source curriculum | Getting open source curriculum into the hands for high school students.
CTE Coding Students | Bringing industry professionals into the class room to inspire them (via zoom). I already did this as a teacher by bringing people from Riot Games / Carvana, Choice Hotels, Auth0, and many others into my classroom. Now I want to streamline this for more schools.
Free Coding Classes on Twitch | I stream open source classes for an introductory javaScript class every week to test the open source curriculum I write. Think of it as a free bootcamp online. I also despritely need a better computer that doesn't require iced gel packs to be able to stream 😅.... 
Lobbying for Open Source Certification | When I taught in a public CTE high school, I couldn't believe that a multiple choice test like th MTA certifications were approved by the state over open source certifications such as Free Code Camp's. I know enough school board members and a few house members to help get the ball rolling but, it's a lot of leg work and I don't want to commit to this without funding...
Laptop | Donating 4G latops/tablets to students struggling with remote academic life. Having taught a few students with bad internet, etc, this is especially important to me but I don't have the resources to address this without funding.
